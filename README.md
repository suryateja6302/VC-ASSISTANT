<h2>About the Project</h2>
With technological advancements and increased use of personal voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google’s Home Assistant. Similarly ,Our Voice Assistant, Buddy will respond to the wake up call of the user by giving a nice greeting and with an introduction of ownself.

Then, it will ask for any voice commands from the user as an input to perform its tasks. Then, the user may ask any general day-to-day friendly query, or query regarding general knowledge, mathematical calculations, science & Technological query, social &cultural query etc. The user’s command is converted to text which is understood by the machine using a STT (Speech To Text) synthesizer. The assistant can send E-mails to others, can post images to the user's Instagram.
